[General]

# Default setting for to indicate whether secure network beaconing
# is enabled for a node whose Beacon state hasn't been configured
# by a configuration client, i.e., for a newly provisioned, created
# or imported node.
# Defaults to true.
#Beacon = true

# Default setting for supporting relay. The setting applies
# to all local nodes.
# If the value is true, then a configuration client can either enable or disable
# the relay feature per local node.
# If the value is false, then the relay feature cannot be configured for
# any local node.
# Defaults to true.
#Relay = true

# Default setting for supporting Friendship. The setting applies
# to all local nodes.
# If the value is true, then a configuration client can either enable or disable
# the Friendship feature per local node.
# If the value is false, then the Friendship feature cannot be configured for
# any local node.
# Defaults to true.
#Friendship = true

# Default depth of replay protection list. This setting applies to
# each individual node.
# Valid range 1-65535.
# Defaults to 100.
#CRPL = 100

# Default size of friend queue: the number of messages that each Friend node can
# store for the Low Power node.
# Valid range: 0-32.
# Defaults to 32.
#FriendQueueSize = 32

# Provisioning timeout in seconds.
# Setting this value to zero means there's no timeout.
# Defaults to 60.
#ProvTimeout = 60


[SARTransmitter]

# Transmission interval step between segments of a message.
# Interval is measured in milliseconds and calculated using the following

#   (SegIntervalStep + 1) * 10 ms.
#
# Valid range 0-15.
# Defaults to 5.
#SegIntervalStep = 5

# Maximum number of retransmissions of segments to a unicast destination.
# Valid range 0-15.
# Defaults to 2.
#UnicastRetransCount = 2

# Maximum number of retransmissions of segments to a unicast destination when no
# acknowledgment is newly received during the retransmission interval.
# This value sould be set to greater than AckRetransCount on a peer node.
# Valid range 0-15.
# Defaults to 2.
#UnicastRetransWithoutProgressCount = 2

# Retransmission interval step between segments of a meesage to a unicast
# destination.
# Interval is measured in milliseconds and calculated using the following
# formula:
#
#   (UnicastRetransIntervalStep + 1) * 25 ms
#
# Valid range 0-15.
# Defaults to 7.
#UnicastRetransIntervalStep = 7

# Interval step between segments of a message to a unicast destination that
# increases proportionally to (ttl - 1) when ttl is over 0.
# Increment is measured in milliseconds and calculated using the following
# formula:
#
#   (UnicastRetransIntervalIncrement + 1) * 25 ms
#
# Valid range 0-15.
# Defaults to 1.
#UnicastRetransIntervalIncrement = 1

# Maximum number of retransmissions of segments to a multicast destination.
# Valid range 0-15.
# Defaults to 2.
#MulticastRetransCount = 2

# Retransmission interval step between segments of a meesage to a multicast
# destination.
# Interval is measured in milliseconds and calculated using the following
# formula:
#
#   (MulticastRetransIntervalStep + 1) * 25 ms
#
# Valid range 0-15.
# Defaults to 8.
#MulticastRetransIntervalStep = 8

[SARReceiver]

# Threshold number of segments in a message to retransmit acknowledgment
# messages. If the number of segments in a message exceeds SegmentsThreshold,
# retransmit the Acknowledgment message by AckRetransCount.
# Valid range 0-31.
# Defaults to 3
#SegmentsThreshold = 3

# Interval increment between acknowledgment messages.
# Increment is measured in segments and calculated using the following formula:
#
#   AckDelayIncrement + 1.5
#
# Valid range 0-7
# Defaults to 1
#AckDelayIncrement = 1

# Maximum number of retransmissions of acknowledgment messages.
# Valid range 0-3
# Defaults to 0
#AckRetransCount = 0

# Timeout to discard a segmented message when no more new segments of the
# message are coming in.
# Timeout is measured in seconds and calculated using the following formula:
#
#   (DiscardTimeout + 1) * 5 sec
#
# Valid range 0-15
# Defaults to 1
#DiscardTimeout = 1

# Interval between received segments of a message. This is used to control rate
# of transmission of acknowledgment messages.
# Increment is measured in milliseconds and calculated using the following
# formula:
#
#   (ReceiverSegIntervalStep + 1) * 10 ms
#
# Valid range 0-15
# Defaults to 5
#ReceiverSegIntervalStep = 5
